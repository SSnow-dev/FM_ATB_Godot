get a target
get in range of target
if in range can attack/engage
if attacking enter engaged state
while engaged attack repeatidly based on attack speed (stat)
(if engaged and time since last attack >= attack speed)
 Attack:
	play attack animation
	calculate damage to target
can move freely except for during attack animation
moving away from target disengages

secondary concerns:
getting a target should involve checking nearby range for attackable entities
then selected one from a list and then choosing attack

calculated damage should be displayed visually over target (or miss, dodge, block ect...)

other possibilities:

engaged state has slower movement speed.
